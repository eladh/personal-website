title: Data in the wild west with some DevOps to the rescue
excerpt:
  Once upon a time, there were just two data pipelines - a data warehouse to support analysis activities, and a reporting pipeline that produced some strange numbers for investors' board meetings ,and all was good. But in today's data wild west, we are getting more demands - from business users who would like to transform their idea into a POC, deploy ML models in production, ensure quality in the data pipeline with regression and anomaly detection. Keeping up with this challenges require an agile, automated, and cost-effective operation that isn't always part of our data team responsibility.
