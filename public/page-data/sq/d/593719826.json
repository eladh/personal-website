But in today's data wild west, we are getting more demands - from business users who would like to transform their idea into a POC, deploy ML models in production, ensure quality in the data pipeline with regression and anomaly detection. Keeping up with this challenges require an agile, automated, and cost-effective operation that isn't always part of our data team responsibility.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/wB2GcPPOyJo/?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0","src":null,"title":"Data in the wild west with some DevOps to the rescue"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/data-in-the-wild-west-with-some-dev-ops-to-the-rescue"}}},{"node":{"id":"a8635e0f-affc-538e-9416-c83ce8977d9e","frontmatter":{"demo":null,"excerpt":"The “rise” of the containers created very interesting opportunities for running and deploying microservices and distributed software in general, like any good thing, it comes with a price. Building a Cloud-Native CI/CD infrastructure utilizing the advantages of containers is quite challenging. In this session, we will introduce the challenges of CI/CD in the cloud native world including building our CI/CD infrastructure as code and working with dynamic workers. We will explore popular projects aiming to help us with these challenges -  Bloody Jenkins, Jenkins X and more.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/9zlEsJuBaGE/?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0","src":null,"title":"CI/CD In The Age Of Cloud-Native"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/ci-cd-in-the-age-of-cloud-native"}}},{"node":{"id":"d4bc7c8f-2f2a-5e63-b7e0-a3b3198a2dd8","frontmatter":{"demo":"//bugvilla.herokuapp.com/","excerpt":"Knative is the new kid in town in the Serverless community.
