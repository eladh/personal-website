But in today's data wild west, we are getting more demands - from business users who would like to transform their idea into a POC, deploy ML models in production, ensure quality in the data pipeline with regression and anomaly detection. Keeping up with this challenges require an agile, automated, and cost-effective operation that isn't always part of our data team responsibility.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/wB2GcPPOyJo/?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0","title":"Data in the wild west with some DevOps to the rescue"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/data-in-the-wild-west-with-some-dev-ops-to-the-rescue"}}},{"node":{"id":"936f36fa-81c5-5f65-add4-4cb89e81b4f0","frontmatter":{"excerpt":"The “rise” of the containers created very interesting opportunities for running and deploying microservices and distributed software in general, like any good thing, it comes with a price. Building a Cloud-Native CI/CD infrastructure utilizing the advantages of containers is quite challenging. In this session, we will introduce the challenges of CI/CD in the cloud native world including building our CI/CD infrastructure as code and working with dynamic workers. We will explore popular projects aiming to help us with these challenges -  Bloody Jenkins, Jenkins X and more.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/9zlEsJuBaGE/?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0","title":"CI/CD In The Age Of Cloud-Native"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/ci-cd-in-the-age-of-cloud-native"}}},{"node":{"id":"90ecb4a2-a8de-5455-a587-230b79ea7795","frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Knative is the new kid in town in the Serverless community. As Kubernetes is de facto our cloud infrastructure Knative is allowing us to focus more on our business logic and less on infrastructure ,All while committing to the new paradigm of Serverless computing.In this session we will explore a high level overview of Knative and follow architectural design of a modern data pipeline shifting from AWS Lambda to Knative.","iframe":"//www.youtube.com/embed/R3W7gYcNgaE/?modestbranding=1&showinfo=0&autohide=1&rel=0","title":"Knative - deploy, and manage modern container-based serverless workloads workload"},"fields":{"slug":"/case-studies/knative-deploy-and-manage-modern-container-based-serverless-workloads-workload"}}}]}}}
